<ul>
<li>All tests are passing in Qualified.</li>
<li>All the props are treated as read-only.</li>
<li>State is never directly mutated; it's only updated via setState(). </li>
<li>The Edit Card and Create Card screens share the same form component.</li>
<li>The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array.</li>
<li>State is "lifted up" to the parent component where appropriate.</li>
<li>All inputs are controlled. Generally, there is a warning on the console when you type into the input box and it changes from uncontrolled to controlled. The warning looks like this: "Warning: Input is changing an uncontrolled input of type <text|number|etc.> to be controlled." This is often the result of initializing the state to null or undefined.</li>
</ul>
